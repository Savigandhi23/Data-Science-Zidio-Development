# Data-Science-Zidio-Development
A Data Science Internship at Zidio Development helped me to gain hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and other data-driven projects. I worked closely with experienced data scientists and engineers, contributing to various aspects of data science workflows, from data collection and preprocessing to modeling and deployment.
